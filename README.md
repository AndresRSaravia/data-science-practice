# Data Science on Weather Datasets

### Description

This project serves as a Data Science practice on the reading, curation, analysis and proposal of prediction models. The dataset used in this case is from  [Zeeshan Ahmad](https://www.kaggle.com/zeeshier)'s [Weather Forecast Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeeshier/weather-forecast-dataset) published in Kaggle. It contains 2500 weather observations with attributes such as Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Cloud Cover and Pressure. Given those attributes, The main goal is to predict whether it rains or not.

The project will be divided in four parts:
1. Data reading and curation: We read the csv file and look for missing and duplicate values.
2. Data analysis: We study the dataset mainly to look for two characteristics
    - Rain vs No rain proportions
    - Key categories
3. Possible models: The dataset page hinted three possible solutions such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. We follow those possibilities but we also explain why other models, which involve SVM and clustering, might not be good enough for this project.
4. Conclusions and final thoughts: We determine which of the three solutions worked better. Moreover, we propose possible improvements for the dataset and other alternative models.
